# print("First Error : Syntax errors")
# print("Syntax errors are the most basic type of error. They arise when the Python parser is unable to understand a line of code. Syntax errors are almost always fatal, i.e. there is almost never a way to successfully execute a piece of code containing syntax errors. Some syntax errors can be caught and handled, like eval(""), but these are rare.In IDLE, it will highlight where the syntax error is. Most syntax errors are typos, incorrect indentation, or incorrect arguments. If you get this error, try looking at your code for any of these")

# print("Second Error : Logic  errors")
# print("These are the most difficult type of error to find, because they will give unpredictable results and may crash your program.  A lot of different things can happen if you have a logic error. However these are very easy to fix as you can use a debugger, which will run through the program and fix any problems.A simple example of a logic error can be showcased below, the while loop will compile and run however, the loop will never finish and may crash Python:")
# print("example:")
# print("#Counting Sheep")
